<p>The <dfn>Private Field Identifier</dfn> specification type is used to describe a globally unique identifier which represents a private field name. A private field identifier may be installed on any ECMAScript object with the PrivateFieldAdd internal algorithm, and then read or written using PrivateFieldGet and PrivateFieldSet.</p>

<p>All ECMAScript objects have a new additional internal slot, [[PrivateFieldValues]], which is a List of Records of the form { [[PrivateFieldIdentifer]]: Private Field Identifier, [[PrivateFieldValue]]: ECMAScript value }. This List represents the values of the private fields for the object. All objects, including Proxies and all host environment-provided objects, have this internal slot, but primitives such as Numbers do not.</p>

<p>
  Private fields are designed to have semantics analogous to WeakMaps. However, the implied garbage collection semantics are weaker: If all the references to a WeakMap are inaccessible, but there is still a reference to a key which was in the WeakMap, one would expect the value to be eventually collected. However, PrivateFieldIdentifiers specifically do not have this connotation: because the reference from the Identifier to the Value is in a Record which the Object points to, the value would not be collected, even if nothing else points to the identifier.

<p>
  Private Field Identifiers are a specification type here, not directly observable to ECMAScript code. However, in <a href="">a decorator integration strawman</a>, an object wrapping Private Field Identifiers would be exposed to allow greater metaprogramming.

<emu-issue>
  Private fields are deliberately inaccessible outside of the class body. It is proposed that there could be an "escape hatch" to access them though some sort of reflective mechanism; see <a href="">the GitHub thread</a>. This proposa deliberately omits any such escape hatch.

<emu-clause id="sec-objectcreate" aoid="ObjectCreate">
  <h1>ObjectCreate (_proto_ [ , _internalSlotsList_ ])</h1>
  <p>The abstract operation ObjectCreate with argument _proto_ (an object or null) is used to specify the runtime creation of new ordinary objects. The optional argument _internalSlotsList_ is a List of the names of additional internal slots that must be defined as part of the object. If the list is not provided, a new empty List is used. This abstract operation performs the following steps:</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. If _internalSlotsList_ was not provided, let _internalSlotsList_ be a new empty List.
    1. Let _obj_ be a newly created object with an internal slot for each name in _internalSlotsList_.
    1. Set _obj_'s essential internal methods to the default ordinary object definitions specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>.
    1. Set _obj_.[[Prototype]] to _proto_.
    1. Set _obj_.[[Extensible]] to *true*.

  <emu-todo>All ECMAScript objects, including Proxies, and any user exotic object, should have a [[PrivateFieldValues]] internal slot iniitlaized to an empty List.</emu-todo>
